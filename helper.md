## Heatmap interpretation

- The heatmap is generated by subtracting the followup vertebral segmentation from the baseline vertebral segmentation, marking the overlapping region with green and missing (decreased height) in red.

- The above mentioned routine depends completely on a successful registration of the correctly segmented vertebral masks. That means, erroneous registrations or inaccurate vertebral segmentations could produce misleading results.

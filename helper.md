## General notes
Please follow the comments in the notebook. Most important things to keep an eye for:
- please choose the rater ID assigned to you
- make sure to set the dataset path correctly
- follow the Rating Schema set below and in the Notebook
- To load all the cases in a given directory, set the `load_all` variable to True
- Don't forget to press the save button below the rating windows and wait for confirmation that the case was successfuly saved (will be displayed right below the the save button)
- To access the database directly, open the csv file generated in the same directory named CTFU_Fx_{your-rater-ID}.csv



## RATING SCHEMA
Morphologic changes affecting the vertebral body:

0 - Normal morphology (no height loss, no severe degenerative changes, no metastasis)

1 - Genant grade 1 (with cortical fx)

2 - Genant grade 2

3 - Genant grade 3

4 - Schmorl's herniation (upper or lower endplate)

5 - Non-osteoporotic fx (developmental, traumatic, non-determined)

6 - Trabecular sclerotic changes in >=1/3 of VB (eg type 3 Modic changes)

7 - Lesions adjacent to cortical bone (at ligament, enthesis; DISH, ankylosing spondilitis, large bridging osteophytes affecting >=1/3 of a VB surface) 

8 - Foreign material (PMMA, metal)

9 - malignant fracture

10 - Osteolytic/osteoblastic bone metastasis without fx

11 - Unclear lesion to be excluded from BMD analysis (e.g. haemangioma, osteoma)


## Heatmap interpretation

- The heatmap is generated by subtracting the followup vertebral segmentation from the baseline vertebral segmentation, marking the overlapping region with green and missing (decreased height) in red.

- The above mentioned routine depends completely on a successful registration of the correctly segmented vertebral masks. That means, erroneous registrations or inaccurate vertebral segmentations could produce misleading results.
